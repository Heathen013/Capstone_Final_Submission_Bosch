## üè¢ Executive Summary (Business-Facing)

**Problem Statement:**  
Bosch‚Äôs production lines generate millions of sensor readings per part. Even a tiny fraction of defective outputs can translate to large warranty costs, recalls, and customer churn. Traditional quality checks often miss rare but critical failures. This project builds a machine learning pipeline that detects rare defects in Bosch‚Äôs production line dataset, tackling extreme class imbalance while preserving real-world utility.

**Business Goals:**  
- Reduce defective shipments and warranty claims.  
- Improve efficiency by identifying risks earlier in the process.  
- Provide a scalable, data-driven quality assurance framework.  

**Key Outcomes:**  
- Built a full pipeline across numeric, categorical, and date features with strict leakage control, deferred encoding, and correlation pruning.  
- Selected **Gradient Boosting** as the best core learner by AUC.  
- Tuned Gradient Boosting via **RandomizedSearchCV**. Achieved best held-out AUC ‚âà **0.6368** with improved precision.  
- Implemented **advanced resampling**: SMOTE, ADASYN, Borderline-SMOTE, SMOTE-ENN, SMOTE-Tomek, and RandomUnderSampler. SMOTE/SMOTE-ENN provided the best balance.  
- Ran **threshold tuning** on predicted probabilities guided by precision‚Äìrecall curves to find operating points that reflect business priorities.  
- Produced a **learning curve analysis** showing slight overfitting, with strategies proposed to mitigate it.

## üéØ Problem Statement

- **Goal:** Predict whether a part fails quality control (`Response = 1`) using anonymized line, station, and time-derived features.  
- **Challenge:** Extreme class imbalance (positives <1%).  
- **Context:** Features are split into numerical, categorical, and date files. Date features timestamp when each measurement occurred; names encode line and station provenance.  

---

## üì¶ Data Acquisition

The Bosch Production Line Dataset consists of three distinct files:

- **numeric.csv** ‚Äì Contains sensor readings from various stations. These are critical for identifying subtle patterns that may indicate defects.
- **categorical.csv** ‚Äì Encodes station-level identifiers and process flags. These help capture discrete process variations.
- **date.csv** ‚Äì Includes timestamps for each measurement, enabling temporal analysis and feature engineering.

All three datasets were merged on the `Id` column to form a unified view of each part‚Äôs journey through the production line.

### Why These Sources?
- Combining sensor, categorical, and temporal data allows for a richer representation of each part.
- Temporal features help identify delays or anomalies in processing.
- Categorical features capture station-specific behavior.
- Numeric features provide the raw signals for defect detection.

### Visual Assessment
EDA confirmed the value of each source:
- **Timestamp distributions** revealed subtle differences between defective and non-defective parts.
- **Numeric feature distributions** showed multimodal behavior, justifying scaling and outlier handling.
- **Boxplots by response** highlighted weak but consistent signals across all three data types.

These insights validated the inclusion of all three sources in the final model pipeline.

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA highlighted key challenges and guided preprocessing:

- **Temporal Features:**  
  Products show distinct patterns in earliest and latest timestamps. Defective vs. non-defective products have slightly different distributions.
  ![Distribution of Earliest Timestamp per Product](figures/Distribution_of_Earliest_Timestamp_per_Product.png)  
  ![Distribution of Latest Timestamp per Product](figures/Distribution_of_Latest_Timestamp_per_Product.png)  
  ![Distribution of Timestamp Count per Product](figures/Distribution_of_Timestamp_Count_per_Product.png)  

- **Numeric Features:**  
  Example distributions of early‚Äëline features (L0_S0_F0, L0_S0_F2, L0_S0_F4, L0_S0_F6, L0_S0_F8) show near‚Äënormal or multimodal shapes, confirming the need for scaling and variance filtering.  
  ![Distribution of L0_S0_F0](figures/Distribution_of_L0_S0_F0.png)  
  ![Distribution of L0_S0_F2](figures/Distribution_of_L0_S0_F2.png)  
  ![Distribution of L0_S0_F4](figures/Distribution_of_L0_S0_F4.png)  
  ![Distribution of L0_S0_F6](figures/Distribution_of_L0_S0_F6.png)  
  ![Distribution of L0_S0_F8](figures/Distribution_of_L0_S0_F8.png)  

- **Boxplots vs Response:**  
  Earliest/Latest timestamps and timestamp counts show subtle but visible differences between defective and non-defective products.  
  ![Earliest Timestamp vs Response](figures/Earliest_Timestamp_vs_Response.png)  
  ![Latest Timestamp vs Response](figures/Latest_Timestamp_vs_Response.png)  
  ![Timestamp Count vs Response](figures/Timestamp_Count_vs_Response.png)  

**Takeaway:**  
EDA confirmed high sparsity, imbalance, and subtle temporal/numeric signals. These insights justified feature engineering (temporal aggregates), variance filtering, and imbalance‚Äëaware modeling.

## üßº Data Preprocessing & Encoding

### üîç Analysis & Cleaning Steps

- **Missing Value Handling:**
  - Dropped features with 100% missing values across numeric, categorical, and date datasets.
  - Deferred imputation using `SimpleImputer` and `KNNImputer` for numeric and categorical features.
  - Logged all dropped and deferred columns in `processing_logs/`.

- **Outlier Detection:**
  - Applied IQR-based outlier detection on numeric features.
  - Logged potential outliers and deferred handling to avoid premature assumptions.

- **Low Variance & Constant Features:**
  - Removed features with zero variance or constant values.
  - Logged dropped features for reproducibility.

- **High Cardinality Categorical Features:**
  - Dropped categorical features with excessive unique values (e.g., >1000 categories).
  - Justified based on memory constraints and encoding complexity.

---

### üî† Encoding Techniques

- **Mean Response Encoding:**
  - Applied to categorical features with moderate cardinality.
  - Encoded each category with the mean of the target variable (`Response`).
  - Helps preserve signal without exploding dimensionality.

- **One-Hot Encoding (Deferred):**
  - Considered for low-cardinality categorical features.
  - Deferred due to memory constraints and lack of interpretability in anonymized data.

- **Date Feature Transformation:**
  - Converted raw timestamps into engineered features

## ü§ñ Modeling

*(Baseline models, Gradient Boosting best by AUC, RandomizedSearchCV tuning.)*

### üîÄ Train-Test Split

- **Method:** Stratified split to preserve class imbalance  
- **Ratio:** 80% training / 20% testing  
- **Random State:** 42 for reproducibility  
- **Target:** `Response` column  
- **Identifier Retained:** `Id` preserved for traceability

### ü§ñ Model Selection Rationale

- **Random Forest:** Robust to noise and handles high-dimensional data  
- **Gradient Boosting:** Known for strong performance on tabular data  
- **SVC & KNN:** Included for completeness and benchmarking  
Gradient Boosting was selected as the final model due to its superior AUC and ability to capture complex interactions.

---

## üîß Hyperparameter Tuning

To optimize the Gradient Boosting model, `RandomizedSearchCV` was used with a reduced parameter space to balance performance and compute cost.

- **Parameter Distributions:**
  - `n_estimators`: 100‚Äì300
  - `learning_rate`: 0.01‚Äì0.05
  - `max_depth`: 3‚Äì5
  - `min_samples_split`: 2‚Äì10
  - `min_samples_leaf`: 1‚Äì4

- **Tuning Strategy:**
  - 3-fold cross-validation
  - AUC used as scoring metric
  - 30 iterations sampled

- **Best Parameters Found:**
  ```python
  {'n_estimators': 240, 'learning_rate': 0.037, 'max_depth': 4, 'min_samples_split': 5, 'min_samples_leaf': 2}

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Future Work

### üîç Limitations

- **Moderate AUC Performance:**  
  Despite extensive tuning and resampling, the best model achieved an AUC of approximately 0.6368. This reflects the challenge of detecting rare defects in highly imbalanced data.

- **Low Recall at Default Thresholds:**  
  Most baseline models failed to identify defective parts without threshold tuning, resulting in poor recall and high false negatives.

- **Synthetic Oversampling Risks:**  
  Techniques like SMOTE and ADASYN may introduce unrealistic synthetic samples, which can affect generalization on real-world data.

- **Feature Interpretability Constraints:**  
  Due to anonymized feature names and lack of domain-specific metadata, interpreting feature importance is limited.

- **Computational Constraints:**  
  Full dataset training was deferred due to resource limitations. Current results are based on sampled subsets of the Bosch dataset.

---

## üöÄ Future Work/Next Steps

- **Cost-Sensitive Learning:**  
  Implement algorithms that penalize false negatives more heavily to align with Bosch‚Äôs business priorities.

- **Station-Level Feature Engineering:**  
  Derive features based on station transitions, time gaps, and process flow to capture richer temporal dynamics.

- **Ensemble Imbalance Learners:**  
  Explore advanced models like EasyEnsemble and Balanced Random Forest to improve minority
