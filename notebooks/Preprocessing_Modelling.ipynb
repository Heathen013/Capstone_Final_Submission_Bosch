        "    *   `min_samples_leaf`: Increase the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. This also prevents creating leaves based on very few samples.\n",
        "    *   `subsample`: Introduce randomness by training each tree on a random fraction of the training data (e.g., 0.8 for 80%). This is a form of bagging.\n",
        "    *   `max_features`: Consider a random subset of features when looking for the best split.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Increase `n_estimators` (with Early Stopping):** While increasing the number of estimators *can* lead to overfitting if not controlled, using early stopping in conjunction with a larger number of estimators allows the model to train only as long as performance on a validation set is improving.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Reduce `learning_rate`:** A smaller learning rate requires more estimators but can lead to a more robust model that generalizes better.\n",

        "\n",
        "*   **Accuracy:** Accuracy remained very high (around 0.994) both before and after tuning. However, due to the severe class imbalance, Accuracy is not the most informative metric for this problem.\n",
        "*   **Precision:** Precision saw a significant increase after tuning (from 0.0909 to 0.3333). This indicates that when the tuned model predicts a positive case, it is more likely to be correct compared to the untuned model. This is a positive outcome of tuning.\n",
        "*   **Recall:** Recall remained low (around 0.0667) both before and after tuning. This suggests that even with tuning, the model still struggles to identify a large proportion of the actual positive cases.\n",
        "*   **F1-score:** The F1-score, which is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall, also saw an improvement after tuning (from 0.0769 to 0.1111). This reflects the gain in Precision, although the low Recall still keeps the F1-score relatively low.\n",
        "*   **AUC:** The AUC score saw a slight increase after tuning (from 0.6357 to 0.6368). While the improvement is marginal, AUC is a robust metric for imbalanced data and shows a small positive impact of tuning on the model's ability to distinguish between the two classes.\n",

        "\n",
        "Hyperparameter tuning of the Gradient Boosting model resulted in a noticeable improvement in **Precision** and a slight increase in **AUC**. While **Recall** remains a challenge, the tuned model is better at avoiding false positives when it does predict a positive case. This suggests that the tuning process helped to refine the model's decision boundaries to be more accurate for the minority class, although the difficulty in identifying all positive cases (Recall) persists due to the dataset's imbalance and potentially the inherent complexity of the problem."

        "## Model Selection\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the comprehensive evaluation of various models and resampling techniques, the **Gradient Boosting Classifier with ADASYN Resampling** is selected as the final model for predicting product failures. Here is the detailed justification:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Objective of the Problem:** The core objective is to accurately predict product failures in a high-dimensional manufacturing process. This requires a model that can effectively handle the class imbalance inherent in manufacturing failure data and provide reliable predictions of the minority class (failures).\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Evaluation Metrics:** Given the imbalanced nature of the dataset (very few failures compared to non-failures), metrics like Accuracy can be misleading. Instead, metrics that specifically assess performance on the minority class and the model's ability to distinguish between classes are crucial.\n",
        "    *   **AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve):** This metric measures the model's ability to discriminate between positive and negative classes across all possible classification thresholds. It is robust to class imbalance and provides a good overall measure of model performance. The **Gradient Boosting Classifier with ADASYN Resampling** achieved the highest AUC (0.6522) among all models evaluated, indicating superior discriminative power.\n",
        "    *   **Precision:** This metric measures the accuracy of the positive predictions (i.e., out of all predicted failures, how many were actual failures). A higher precision is desirable to minimize false positives, which can lead to unnecessary inspections or interventions. While still relatively low, the tuned Gradient Boosting model *without* resampling showed the highest precision (0.3333). However, this came at the cost of very low recall.\n",
        "    *   **Recall:** This metric measures the model's ability to find all the positive cases (i.e., out of all actual failures, how many were correctly identified). A higher recall is important to minimize false negatives, which means failing to detect a faulty product. Undersampling (RUS) showed a high recall (0.4667), but with extremely low precision and AUC.\n",
        "    *   **F1-score:** This metric is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall, providing a single score that balances both. It is a good indicator of a model's performance on the minority class.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Handling Class Imbalance:** The severe class imbalance is a major challenge. Techniques like oversampling (SMOTE, ADASYN, BorderlineSMOTE), combined resampling (SMOTE-ENN, SMOTE-Tomek), and imbalanced ensemble methods (BalancedBaggingClassifier, EasyEnsembleClassifier, BalancedRandomForestClassifier) were explored to address this.\n",
        "    *   **ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling):** This technique is similar to SMOTE but focuses on generating synthetic samples for minority class instances that are harder to learn (near the decision boundary). The evaluation showed that training the tuned Gradient Boosting model on ADASYN resampled data resulted in the highest AUC, suggesting that ADASYN helped the model better distinguish between the classes in this specific dataset compared to other resampling methods.\n",
        "    *   While some imbalanced ensemble methods (like EasyEnsembleClassifier) achieved competitive AUCs, they often resulted in extremely low precision, making them less practical for a manufacturing setting where minimizing false positives is also important.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Model Interpretability:** Gradient Boosting models, while powerful, can be less directly interpretable than simpler models like Logistic Regression or Decision Trees. However, techniques like feature importance (which can be derived from the trained model) and permutation importance can still provide insights into which features are most influential in the predictions. This aligns with the problem requirement for interpretable insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Gradient Boosting Classifier with ADASYN Resampling** strikes the best balance among the evaluated approaches for this problem. It demonstrates the highest discriminative power (AUC) on the test set, indicating its superior ability to rank failure instances higher than non-failure instances. While Precision and Recall remain challenging due to the dataset's nature, the combination of a tuned Gradient Boosting model and ADASYN resampling provides the most promising performance profile according to the chosen evaluation metrics for an imbalanced classification task. Future work can explore further tuning of this specific model and resampling technique, as well as delving deeper into feature importance analysis for interpretability."

        "## Limitations and Future Work\n",
        "\n",
        "This section identifies the key limitations of the current model and approach, along with potential areas for future improvement and further research, taking into account the constraints faced during this project.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Limitations of the Current Approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Data Usage due to Compute Resources:** Due to limitations in compute resources and memory, the analysis was performed on a sampled subset of the complete dataset. This means the model was trained on a smaller portion of the available data, which might impact its ability to capture all patterns present in the full dataset and generalize to all manufacturing variations. Processing the data in chunks and creating a smaller dataset was a necessary step to make the analysis feasible within the available environment.\n",
        "2.  **Simplified Imputation Strategy:** Simple median imputation was used for missing values in both numeric and date features. More sophisticated imputation techniques like KNNImputer or IterativeImputer were not used initially due to complexity, time, and compute constraints. These methods can potentially provide more accurate imputations by considering the relationships between features.\n",
        "3.  **Imputation Order and Potential (though minimal) Data Leakage:** While imputation was primarily done before the train-test split for simplicity and manageability in a high-dimensional dataset, there is a theoretical potential for minimal data leakage.\n",
        "    *   **Justification for Minimal Leakage:** For the initial column-wise imputation steps (100% missing, low variance, constant values), these were based on properties inherent to the columns themselves, independent of specific row values. For the median imputation *before* the split, while using the overall median might introduce a slight leak (as the test set median is implicitly used), the impact is expected to be minimal given the large dataset size and the nature of median imputation compared to methods that might use more complex patterns from the entire dataset. Deferring all imputation until after the split, especially for such a high-dimensional and complex dataset with various data types, was deemed beyond the scope of current time and effort availability, particularly when considering more advanced imputation methods.\n",
        "4.  **Handling of Advanced Preprocessing and Derived Features:** While some derived date features were created, more extensive feature engineering, especially involving interactions between features or creating features based on domain knowledge across the merged dataset, was limited by time and complexity. Implementing imputation (particularly KNN) after merging the large number of derived and original columns was also beyond the scope of the current effort.\n",
        "5.  **Feature Interactions:** Due to the large number of features, comprehensive checking and engineering of interaction terms among features was not performed. Potential synergistic effects between different sensor signals that might be predictive of failure may have been missed.\n",
        "6.  **Outlier Detection and Handling:** Outlier detection and handling were not explicitly performed in this analysis. Outliers in the data could potentially influence the model training and performance, especially for models sensitive to extreme values. A thorough outlier analysis often requires domain expertise to determine appropriate handling strategies (e.g., capping, transformation, removal).\n",
        "7.  **Randomized Search vs. Grid Search:** Hyperparameter tuning was performed using `RandomizedSearchCV` rather than `GridSearchCV`. While `RandomizedSearchCV` is more computationally efficient and often finds good hyperparameters, `GridSearchCV` performs an exhaustive search over the defined parameter grid, which could potentially find a better combination of hyperparameters if compute resources were not a constraint.\n",
        "8.  **Model Regularization:** The Gradient Boosting model has built-in regularization parameters (`learning_rate`, `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, `min_samples_leaf`, `subsample`, etc.). Tuning these parameters (as done in the hyperparameter tuning step) helps to control model complexity and reduce overfitting.\n",
        "    *   **Addressing Overfitting Resolution:** The learning curve for the model showed signs of slight overfitting (training score higher than cross-validation score). The regularization parameters tuned during `RandomizedSearchCV` (reducing `max_depth`, increasing `min_samples_split`/`min_samples_leaf`, using a smaller `learning_rate` with sufficient `n_estimators`) are intended to mitigate this. Increasing `n_estimators` alone can worsen overfitting without other controls. More data is generally beneficial but, in this case, we used a sampled chunk of the available data. While we couldn't use *all* data at once due to compute limits, the approach of sampling allows for potentially training on *different* chunks of data in the future if needed. Exploring more aggressive regularization techniques or simpler model architectures could also help if overfitting persists.\n",
        "9.  **Evaluation Metric Focus:** The initial hyperparameter tuning and model selection primarily focused on maximizing AUC, which is a good overall metric for imbalanced datasets. However, for predicting product failures, Precision (minimizing false positives) and Recall (minimizinf false negatives) are often critical business metrics. While AUC was prioritized, the analysis did look at other metrics, and a comparison specifically focused on optimizing for F1-score (balancing Precision and Recall) was suggested as a future step.\n",
        "    *   **Achieving Higher Precision and Recall:** The current model (Gradient Boosting with ADASYN, tuned for AUC) achieved a Precision of 0.1111 and a Recall of 0.0667 on the test set. Ideally, for a manufacturing failure prediction system, we would aim for significantly higher values for both Precision and Recall to minimize both false positives and false negatives. The F1-score was 0.0833.\n",
        "    *   **Outcome of F1 Optimization Attempt:** We compared models based on F1-score (in cell `c30a4c34`) and found the highest F1-score achieved by any model evaluated was **0.1111** (by the Tuned Gradient Boosting model, without explicit resampling before tuning). Threshold adjustment on the AUC-tuned model (in cell `d81389f6`) could slightly improve its F1-score to **0.1053**, but did not surpass the highest observed F1. This indicates that optimizing solely for F1 or adjusting the threshold on the current model did not lead to a significant breakthrough in balancing Precision and Recall. Achieving substantially higher values for both metrics likely requires addressing the fundamental limitations outlined above.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Future Work and Potential Improvements:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Explore Full Dataset or Larger Chunks:** If computational resources become available, train the model on the full dataset or significantly larger sampled chunks to potentially improve generalization.\n",
        "2.  **Advanced Imputation Techniques:** Investigate and implement more sophisticated imputation methods (e.g., KNNImputer, IterativeImputer) after the train-test split to potentially handle missing values more effectively and prevent any form of data leakage.\n",
        "3.  **Comprehensive Outlier Analysis and Handling:** Perform a dedicated outlier detection and handling step, potentially involving domain experts to understand the nature of outliers and choose appropriate mitigation strategies. Log detected outliers for review.\n",
        "4.  **Grid Search for Hyperparameter Tuning:** Conduct a more exhaustive `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning if compute resources allow, to potentially find a better set of hyperparameters.\n",
        "5.  **Cost-Sensitive Learning:** Implement cost-sensitive learning approaches, where the model is trained to incur a higher penalty for misclassifying the minority class (false negatives) or the majority class (false positives), based on the specific business costs associated with each type of error.\n",
        "6.  **Explore Different Resampling Strategies or Ratios:** Experiment with other advanced resampling techniques (e.g., Borderline-SMOTE variants, SMOTE-NC for mixed data types if applicable) or different resampling ratios to find the optimal balance for the dataset.\n",
        "7.  **Investigate Other Imbalanced Ensemble Methods:** Further tune and evaluate imbalanced ensemble methods (like EasyEnsembleClassifier) which showed promising Recall or AUC in initial runs, to see if their Precision can be improved.\n",
        "8.  **Deep Feature Engineering:** Conduct more in-depth feature engineering based on domain expertise to create features that are more predictive of product failures.\n",
        "9.  **Explore Alternative Model Architectures:** Evaluate other model architectures that are known to perform well on imbalanced data or high-dimensional sparse data (e.g., LightGBM with appropriate parameters for imbalance, CatBoost, or even deep learning approaches if justified by data volume and complexity).\n",
        "10. **Threshold Adjustment:** Analyze the precision-recall curve and potentially adjust the classification threshold of the final model to favor higher Recall or higher Precision, depending on the specific business requirements (e.g., is it more critical to catch all failures, even with false alarms, or to minimize false alarms, even if some failures are missed?).\n",
        "11. **Feature Importance and Interpretability Deep Dive:** Conduct a detailed analysis of feature importance (using methods like permutation importance) to gain deeper insights into which specific sensor signals are most indicative of failure risk, providing actionable insights for manufacturing engineers."

        "The goal of this project is to accurately predict product failures in a high-dimensional manufacturing process using presence-based signal extraction and interpretable machine learning techniques. The challenge lies in the severe class imbalance, where failures are rare events. By identifying failure-prone products early, manufacturers can implement proactive quality control measures, reducing costs and risks.\n",
